# ReactReduxTestNumberOne

Simple React and Redux connection example.

## About this project
This is a very easy example in order to start understanding how to connect React and Redux.
The functionality is simple:
A book list is shown: as soon as you click a book, it will display the details about the book.

## How can I run the project?
1. Clone (or download as zip) this project  
`git clone https://github.com/Jesus-Gonzalez/ReactReduxTestNumberOne.git`

2. Install project dependencies  
`npm install`

3. Start the project  
`npm start`

4. Browse the project.  
In your web browser navigate to: `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/`

## Something else?

Of course. I'll link you to another example. This time, you will be able to choose a book category,
the app will make an AJAX request to a *.json file, simulating an async request to an API or to database,
in order to get the book list for a specific category.

More examples to come, using React Router and implementing testing with mocha, chai and enzyme libraries.

Stay tuned! :)
